<!-- Overall HTML looks great, indents are good, nice job on using IDs and class names when styling vs using JS to target! One thing to maybe think about is using article vs section, 
  HTML gives you an article tag for things that might actually resemble an article, blog post, etc... it could be good to use section tags instead since most of these areas of the page
are not actual articles, that said peoples opinions on this might vary, that is how I was taught. It is perfectly acceptable to wrap an element in a div if all you are using the div for is styling. -->
